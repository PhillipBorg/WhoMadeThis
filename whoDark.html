		<h1>whomadethis?</h1>
		<p>I made this.</p>
		<p>I used HTML to write the text and CSS to position the text, and for hosting I used github pages. That's it.</p>
		<p>There are no scripts, no images, no geekie jargon.</p>
		<p>There's text, though.</p>
		<p>Text that I wrote. Text that I put on a website. 
		The text isn't that well written, and the page isn't that well looking, 
		but it's words, thoughts.
		</p>
		<p>Thoughts written down. Few thoughts make it this far.</p>
		<p>I can make the thoughts be <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, 
		and even <a href="index.html">links</a>. </p>
		<p>I learned to write this in a day. How good will I be in a week? A month? A life?</p>
		<p>How good will <em>you</em> be in a day? A month? A life?</p>
		<p>Let's find out together!</p>
